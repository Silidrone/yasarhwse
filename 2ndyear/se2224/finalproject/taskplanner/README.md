I've decided to keep the "Show All Tasks" button after all, but I still internally update the state of the table automatically. I did this because user might want to manually press "Show All Tasks" to see all tasks after s/he had applied some kind of filtering. I am writing it here so no confusion happens as I was talking about this issue over email but I didn't want to bother you with more emails.
