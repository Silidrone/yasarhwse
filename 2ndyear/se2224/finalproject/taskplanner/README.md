I've decided to keep the "Show All Tasks" button after all, but I still internally update the state of the table automatically. I did this because user might want to manually press "Show All Tasks" to see all tasks after s/he had applied some kind of filtering. I am writing it here so no confusion happens as I was talking about this issue over email, but I didn't want to bother you with more emails.
Also, the username and password are:
username: muhamed
password: cicak12345

It is saved as a BCrypt hash (10 log_rounds) in the DB so I had to state it here.

The database is MYSQL,

host: localhost
username: root
password: mynewpassword
database: taskplanner
