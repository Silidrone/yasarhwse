Question 1
-----------
2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?


Question 2
------------
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is 385. (1^2+2^2....10^2) = 385
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is 3025. (1+2+3...10)^2 = 3025
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of
the sum is 3025-385 = 2640.
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square
of the sum.


Question 3
-----------
A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects.
For example, 3124 is one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4.
If all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order.
The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:


012   021   102   120   201   210


What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9? (solve in O(n) time)
