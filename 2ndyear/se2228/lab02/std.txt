Question 1
-----------
Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits.
Find the upper limit for the possible numbers and the sum of these numbers.


Question 2
-----------
145 is a curious number, as 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.
Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.
Note: As 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included.


Question 3
-----------
The prime 41, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:
41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13
This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below one-hundred.
The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds to a prime, contains 21 terms, and is equal to 953.
Which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes?
Answer = (Result : 997651)
