SE 4XXX Introduction To Reinforcement Learning

Fall-2023

About the Course:

Reinforcement Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning but is also a general purpose formalism for automated decision-making and AI. This course introduces students to statistical learning techniques where an agent explicitly takes actions and interacts with the world. Understanding the importance and challenges of learning agents that make decisions is of vital importance today, with more and more companies interested in interactive agents and intelligent decision-making.

The course contains fundamental concepts as listed:

Formalization of problems as Markov Decision Processes
Basic exploration methods and the exploration/exploitation tradeoff
Value functions as a general-purpose tool for optimal decision-making
Application of dynamic programming as an efficient solution approach to an industrial control problem
Temporal-Difference learning and Monte Carlo as two strategies for estimating value functions from sampled experience
Exploration methods in DPExpected Sarsa and Q-learning (two TD methods for control)
Planning with simulated experience (as opposed to classic planning strategies)
A model-based approach to RL called Dyna, which uses simulated experience
The aim of the course is to demonstrate the theoretical foundations and the applications of Reinforcement Learning methods

Course instructor: Dr. Dindar Ã–z
