Here, I have violated the DRY principle because we still didn't cover arrays in our theoretical classes and I couldn't use it. Usually I would create a separate get_digits function and use it in both calculating the digital summation of n and when printing the digits of n, but now, I need to have the same code pattern twice. I just wanted to say that because I don't feel comfortable violating the DRY principle without an explanation. I compiled my code with gcc with the -lm flag because I am using math.h for using the sqrt function to check if a number is perfect square or not. I hope everything is okay with the homework.
