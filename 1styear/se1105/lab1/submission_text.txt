I tried to stay within the scope of what has been covered in the theory classes from the C language. I realize the code does not follow the DRY principle and it has many points that could be improved, but since I am staying in the scope of basic code writing, I think it is okay. I added two extra options: milk and discount coupon. If the customer decides to have milk, they pay extra 2 TL. If the customer has discount coupon they get 10% discount. I used gcc to compile the code when testing on my machine. I hope everything is okay about the homework.
